# Welcome! 

Hi, my name is Brittany Owen and welcome to my portfolio repo. 

I recently completed the Software Engineering Immersive program at General Assembly and am excited to kick-start my software engineering career.

Feel free to take a look at my code and reach out if you have any questions.
